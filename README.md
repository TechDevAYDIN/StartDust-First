# StartDust-First
This project is my first game that I developed and designed with Unity. It is a simple 2d game where the player has to reach wormholes and avoid obstacles each level. The game has same levels with different diffuculties, power-ups and obstacles that make it very challenging.

I started this project when I was learning Unity and C#, so the code is not very clean and optimized. However, I decided to share this project on GitHub because it is my first one and it has a lot of features that I like. I learned a lot from this project and I am proud of what I achieved.
